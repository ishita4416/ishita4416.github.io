## picoCTF writeups- Practice

---

### 1. Obedient Cat:  

```cat flag```
the flag is in the direct output  

### 2. Mod 26:  *Cryptography*  

pass the given text through any ROT13 decoders  

> ROT13 is a special case of Caeser Cipher, where the string is rotated by 13 positions. Since, the number of rotations are known, it is more easily break-able than even Caeser Cipher, and hence of no practical usage.  

### 3. Python Wrangling:  

``` wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b351a89e0bc6745b00716849105f87c6/ende.py
    python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en
```

``` cat pw.txt ```
and enter that in the prompt as given by the python script

> wget command is used to retrieve content from web servers
> -d taken in the python command, as per usage defined by the script  

### Wave a Flag:  

``` wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/cfea736820f329083dab9558c3932ada/warm  
    chmod +x warm  
    ./warm  
    ./warm -h
```

> -h passed because of the promt as given by the executable file  


### information:  *forensics*  

metadata of the jpg file to be seen  
followed the writeup: [this](https://ctftime.org/writeup/26973)  

found a really cool site that pretty much uses all the tools in one place for image analysis: [this](https://aperisolve.fr/96a7f666c0bf82891135e98c8c2e5bea)  

the text in the license looks off to the trained eye, passing it through
