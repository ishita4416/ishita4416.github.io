title: Learning Markdown 
---

Esentially I wanted to use this blog to just be able to keep track of my progress while I am studying for Cybersec, or anything for that matter, but since it has been a rather long time since I di something even slightly Webdev centric, I thought it would be nice to start using this initially for learning how to use it itself.

## Headers

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Underlined style Alt-H1
=======

Underlined style Alt-H2
------

## Emphasis

Italics with * single asterisk* or _single underscore_
Bold with **double asterisk** or __double underscore__
Combined emphasis with **asterisk at beginning and _underscore at beginning and astersik at end_**
Strikethrough using tilde ~~two tildes~~

## Lists

1. Just number and list item
2. another item etc
..* Unordered sub-list
..1. Ordered sub-list
4. and different numbers will still give the reqd list

...Properly indented paragraphs within list items using a blank line and leading spaces to align the raw markdown

to break a line without using the paragraph, two trailing spaces need to be used..
this next line would be in the next line, but also in the same paragraph

* unordered lists can use asterisks
+ as well as pluses
- and minuses
