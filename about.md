Hey there! I am currently a sophomore doing Computer Engineering in Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala. My interests vary from Cyber Security and cryptography, to writing poems. I love trying out new things and exploring every possible niche and meeting new people along the way. I am a fast learner, which motivates me to spend my time exploring different aspects of what I come across. Still on the path of figuring out what it is that makes me tick.
